// LiterallyJustMod implements the logic for converting a
// SHA512/256 hash to a value between 0-q by taking the number modulo q.
// XXX: this is only safe if used with values of q that are extremely close
// to a power of 2. The order of secp256k1 happens to be one of those values,
// and the bias introduced by the modulus is around 1.27*2^-128.
// The same applies to the order of curve25519.
